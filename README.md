# mtikrtr
Configure basic settings on a MikroTik router.

Settings you can configure:
  * Network name (SSID)
  * Password (WPA, WPA2)
  * 2.4Ghz channels

Tested equipment:
  * hAP lite

To run, enter the current directory and run:
`python3 sandbox.py`

If you have any problems, email me or fix it yourself and send in your commits to the `dev` branch and make a PR. Commits on master will not be accepted unless through supreme authority (aka me).
If you would like to add tested equipment, email me as well and we can discuss things!
